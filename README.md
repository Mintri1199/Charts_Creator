# Charts_Creator
Project for Term 1 2018 intensive at Make School 

The inspiration for this project is to create an app that would allow the user to create simple pie chart quickly while giving them the ability to customize their values.

### Design
The app must be easy to use, with using as few ViewControllers as possible.
It is also my first attempt at developing an iOS app thus I relied heavily on storyboards.

### Structure
* Uing the [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) library for the pie chart creation function.
* All scenes are created using storyboards.
* Used singleton and unwind as methods of passing data.

### Demo
